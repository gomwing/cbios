v0.26 alpha2

- Fixed GTTRIG to return flag-Z correctly for the joystick ports
- Added a catch all routine to report illegal direct calls made to the end of
  the frame-1.
- Fixed a bug in search_roms_init_waitv that caused it to corrupt the current
  slot number, thus causing the diskROM to fail to boot.
- Implemented the BEEP (00C0h) routine
- Fixed CHGCLR to set the colors correcly for all screen modes
- CHPUT now shows the cursor when prompting for a character
- Fixed a bug in chget_restore_cursor that resulted in a corrupted cursor
  bitmap. 
- The screen is now cleared before booting a disk
- A lot of polishing was made to support stable operation without a BASIC
  interpreter.  Many of the solutions came from observing how the BASIC
  interpreter was removed from the ROM of the IBM-PCs back in the days.
  Instead of just aborting with error, C-BIOS will now try it's best to
  allow the processing to continue:
  1) It will call all the hooks that the BASIC would call, in the same sequence.
     This way any programs that called the BASIC and used hooks to be called
     back will work properly
  2) If none of the hooks are used, and there is a disk interface available,
     C-BIOS will politely issue a message about the lack of BASIC interpreter
     and will load the operating system again. This allows programs like
     MEMMAN to work. It will ask endlessly to retry if the operating system
     loading failed.
  3) If none of the options above worked, it will abort with an error informing
     that there's no BASIC or operating system to run.
- Booting disks now work properly with an external disk interface. Tested and
  worked fine with MSX-DOS, MSX-DOS2 and Nextor. Disk games also work.
- Solved the bug that caused SjASMPlus to generate incomplete logo files: The
  INCBIN directive requires all parameters to work properly.
- Implemented MSX-Music's WRTOPL, so games that use this BIOS routine to write
  in the YM2413 chip will now play music fine.
- Adjusted the MSX-Music volume in the openMSX config files to sound closer to
  the Sony MSX2+ machines.
- Added information about the MainROM's 0034h: the Kanji driver defaults
